# US-foreign-aid-visualizer
WIP Dynamic Visualization for US Foreign Aid - built using d3.js

Originally CS3300 Project 1 - a static data visualization.
I will be updating this to be dynamic and interactive.
See WrittenReport.txt for a much more detailed description.

To do:
- add tooltips to countries
- add slider to filter out which arcs to display by aid threshold
- add selector to change which variable is shown on the choropleth
- add comparison tool to compare data for two different countries, add small multiples to comparison tool and remove below main map
