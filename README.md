# US-foreign-aid-visualizer
WIP Dynamic Visualization for US Foreign Aid - built using d3.js

Originally my CS3300 Project 1 - a static data visualization.
I will be updating this to make it an useful and interactive for visualizing American foreign aid spending.
See WrittenReport.txt for a much more detailed description.

To do:
- add tooltips to countries
- ~~add option to filter out which arcs to display by aid threshold~~
- ~~add selector to change which variable is shown on the choropleth~~
- add comparison tool to compare data for two different countries
- ~~remove small multiples below main map~~ and reimpliment elsewhere
