# US-foreign-aid-visualizer
Dynamic Visualization for US Foreign Aid - built using d3.js

View demo at: https://yangdanny97.github.io/US-foreign-aid-visualizer

I hope that this is a useful and interactive tool for visualizing global trends with American foreign aid spending with regards to measurements  such as HDI, democracy index, happiness index, etc.

Features:
- filter metrics to display on map
- filter lines showing flow of money by amount
- compare government type, aid, HDI, etc of 2 countries, with autocomplete
- tooltips showing chart of data about each country when hovering over on map

This was originally built in winter 2016-17 as a static data visualization project for class, and was updated by me in spring/summer 2017.

To do list:
- ~~add tooltips to countries~~
- ~~add option to filter out which arcs to display by aid threshold~~
- ~~add selector to change which variable is shown on the choropleth~~
- ~~add comparison tool to compare data for two different countries~~
- ~~remove small multiples below main map and reimpliment elsewhere~~
