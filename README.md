# US-foreign-aid-visualizer
Dynamic Visualization for US Foreign Aid - built using d3.js

Originally built in winter 2016-17 as a static data visualization.
I will be updating this to make it an useful and interactive for visualizing American foreign aid spending and other information on countries such as HDI, democracy index, happiness index, etc.

See WrittenReport.txt for a much more detailed description and data sources.

To do list:
- ~~add tooltips to countries~~
- ~~add option to filter out which arcs to display by aid threshold~~
- ~~add selector to change which variable is shown on the choropleth~~
- add comparison tool to compare data for two different countries
- ~~remove small multiples below main map and reimpliment elsewhere~~
